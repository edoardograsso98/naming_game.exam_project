# University Project ‚Äì Agent-Based Modeling of the Naming Game with Python and Mesa
This repository contains a group project I participated in for a university exam. The objective was to develop an agent-based model in Python using the Mesa library and analyze the results using statistical techniques.

Our project focused on replicating the Naming Game (also known as the Naming Model), a well-known model that describes how consensus emerges within a closed community through local interactions.

The repository includes:

üìÑ The final project report

üêç Python code for both a minimal model and a more advanced version, which are largely described in the report

This project provided hands-on experience in simulation, collective behavior modeling, and statistical analysis.
